Here
See the little queer
There's a volunteer
Don't you think that he should get haircut
Now
Like in the Marines
All the magazines
Got a way for everyone to shape up

You don't wanna fall behind
Choking on a cloud of fairy dust - fairy dust
Now it's only greed and lust
And pride and lust
And a few other sins

No
See the cherry lips
Hands on the hips
Anyone would think your name was Oscar
Wilde
Think you're pretty smart
Poetry and art
Put him on testosterone and vodka

Calling for the man of steel
To blow you faggots into fairy dust - fairy dust
Now it's only greed and lust
And pride and lust
And a few other sins

We're
Happy to be gay
Showing you the way
Gotta get your head your heart your torso
Hard
Join another gym
Lose your pseudonym
Soon we'll all be straight but only more so

Tell me who you're gonna find
To sprinkle on a little fairy dust - fairy dust
Now it's only greed and lust
And pride and lust
And a few other sins
