Here, see the little queer, there's a volunteer
Don't you think that he should get a haircut now?
Like in the Marines, all in magazines
Got a way for everyone to shape up
You don't wanna fall behind
Choking on a cloud of fairy dust, fairy dust
Now it's only greed and lust, pride and lust
And a few other sins
No, see the cherry lips, hands on the hips
Anyone would think your name was Oscar Wilde
Think you're pretty smart, poetry and art
Put him on testosterone and vodka
Calling for the man of steel
To blow you fagots into fairy dust, fairy dust
Now it's only greed and lust, pride and lust
And a few other sins
We're happy to be gay, showing you the way
Gotta get your head, your heart, you torso hard
Join another gym, lose your pseudonym
Soon we'll all be straight but only more so
Tell me who you're gonna find
To sprinkle on a little fairy dust, fairy dust
Now it's only greed and lust, pride and lust
And a few other sins
