Beneath the ocean
I hear the noise
It's clinging until
the sun is up
You were this dress
and let's see
what's happening there oh
I'm up to whatever you do
You go to wherever I go
Madness is the foundation of
our love anyways
Feel kind of cold then
we're falling down
Don't lose your shoes and
the waves will catch your mind
Feel kind of hot then
we shut it out
Heats are drying your blood up
The masks greet us so nicely
The dolls are dancing
to celebrate
Tonight's the night and we sing
the night away oh
I'm up to whatever you do
You're up to wherever I go
We will see what it is to be
dead or alive
Feel kind of cold then
we're falling down
Don't lose your shoes and
the waves will catch your mind
Feel kind of hot then
we shut it out
The tides show us the way
To what's causing
the wounds here
Feel kind of cold then
we're falling down
Don't lose your shoes and
the waves will catch your mind
Feel kind of hot then
we shut it out
The tides show us the way
Feel kind of cold then
we're falling down
Don't lose your shoes and
the waves will catch your mind
Feel kind of hot then
we shut it out
The tides show us the way
To what's causing the wounds
The sun's rising up
The light's coming up
And we turn into fairy dust
