I know what you go through
I know that I am trouble for
Someone as good as you
You make me feel so new
When nothing is enough
You always make me feel like
I'm a diamond in the rough
When I am with you
Just take this Fairy Dust
Now you're under my spell
So now you must
Try things my way
Just look at me and do
Anything I say
You are A star
That shoots across the sky
Heaven is falling
You're mine
You shine
And you light my way tonight
Heaven is calling
I need someone with me
Who understands and can control
My precious jealousy
And who can let it be
So what is your response?
A girl feels special
when she's given
Everything she wants
Promise it to me
Just take this Fairy Dust
Now you're under my spell
So now you must
Try things my way
Just look at me and do
Anything I say
You are A star
That shoots across the sky
Heaven is falling
You're mine
You shine
And you light my way tonight
Heaven is calling
＜♪＞
And I won't wait for you
I won't share you
If you're not mine then
No-one can have you
Just walk this way and do
Anything I say
＜♪＞
You are A star
That shoots across the sky
Heaven is falling
You're mine
You shine
And you light my way tonight
Heaven is calling
